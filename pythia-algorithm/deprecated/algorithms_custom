def hierarchical(data, similarity=pearson):
    '''
    This method performs hierarchical clustering. It is given a set of data 
    points to be clustered and the similarity metric to be used. It returns 
    the top cluster since it references the two other clusters which have been 
    merged to create it and then each one of them references other two etc. So we
    can just traverse it recursively to get all the clusters. By default Pearson similarity
    is used to measure distances but others can be used too by giving other measures as 
    input.
